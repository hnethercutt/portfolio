# My Portfolio Website

## About
This is my portfolio site! I wanted to make mine simple, and inspired by MySpace, because that's where I coded for the first time (I know, very original). 
The media queries still need a bit of tweaking, and I want to make the CSS more organized, but I'm satisfied with it for right now.
